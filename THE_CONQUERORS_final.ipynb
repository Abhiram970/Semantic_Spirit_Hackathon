            "[<Document: {'content': 'Present day students are much different from the students of the past in many ways.\\nToday, they like to make decisions on their own and plan their future by themselves.\\nHowever, student aspirations on one hand and the demands of the work place on the other\\nhave become highly diverse. Employers expect students to have multi-disciplinary competency,\\nleadership skills, and be ICT (Information and Communication Technology) ready. The rigid,\\ncohort system of learning, offers little flexibility to students in selecting the courses of their\\nchoice and helps little in becoming a well-rounded personality.\\nAs part of continuous improvement in providing quality education, during 2008, VIT has\\ntaken the right step in this direction by introducing the Fully Flexible Credit System (FFCS™)\\ninto its academic curriculum. Through this, the students can register for courses of their\\nchoice altering at will, the pace of learning within the broad framework of an academic course\\nand credit requirements, as time progresses.\\nAnother milestone in implementing FFCS is moving from a fixed time table to a slot- based\\ntimetable. Under this, a student will be able to choose the time he/she wants to attend a\\nclass/ lab and the course faculty. Since they can make their own time table, each student in a\\nclass may have a different timetable of his/her own. In order to make the learning more\\neffective, Project Based Learning (PBL) was introduced in 2010, in which the student\\napplies the course principles by using analytical and critical thinking, creating an opportunity\\nto carry out challenging project(s) as part of a course.\\nStudents also have the option of choosing from a ‘basket of courses’ within each classification.\\nAmple options are given to choose interdisciplinary courses from other programs which will\\nhelp the student develop additional skills. Slow learners will also benefit since important\\ncourses are offered in both semesters in any given academic year. This arrangement helps\\nthe students to re-register the course and clear the backlog in subsequent semesters.\\nSuitable provisions are included to reward academically sound students, allowing them to carry\\nout research activities even in their UG Program.\\nFFCS not only offers a wide choice for students to build their own curriculum, but also\\nenhances their skill in planning. A Proctor / faculty advisor helps the student in identifying the\\ncourses to be studied in each semester based on program requirement, course prerequisites,\\nstudent’s academic ability, interest in various disciplines, past academic history, proposed\\ncourse offerings and other related criteria.\\nDuring 2015 - 16, the concept of Curriculum for Applied Learning (CAL™) was introduced in\\nall Programs of the Institute. Under it, a project component is an integral part of the course\\nstructure. All courses are made student-centric instead of teacher-centric. Learning becomes\\nmore ‘experiential’ by carrying out a project (Project Based Learning) as part of most of the\\ncourses. ‘Learning by doing’ enhances understanding the concepts discussed in the class\\nand make multi- and cross- disciplinary applications possible. Students will be able to take up\\nreal world problems as their course projects and apply their key learning in identifying better\\nsolutions. All courses under CAL are designed to bring out the importance of application to\\nengineering/technological problems, creativity and innovation, developing entrepreneurial\\nskills, rather than by routine learning methodology. The Academic Regulations for CAL is given in\\n“FFCS Academic Regulations Version 3.0”.

All courses are considered to be offered for the entire duration of a \\nsemester. A semester is deemed to have 15 instructional (non-exam) weeks. A class room \\nlecture (L) of 50 minutes duration per week, carried out during all weeks of the semester, shall \\nbe considered as one Instructional Unit or one Credit. A tutorial (T) of 50 minutes duration per \\nweek, carried out during all weeks of the semester, shall be considered as one Instructional Unit \\nor one Credit. A minimum of 100 minutes per week of laboratory session/ practical or field \\nwork/ training (P) or a combination of these, carried out during all weeks of the semester, shall \\nalso be considered as one Instructional Unit or one Credit. A minimum of 4 hours of project \\nactivity (J) per week carried out during all weeks of the semester shall also be considered as \\none Instructional Unit or one Credit. Thus, the LTPJC for each course indicates the number of \\ncredits delivered as Lecture (L), Tutorial (T), Practical (P), Project (J) and the total instructional \\ndelivery indicated as Credits (C).\\nExample:\\nAn LTPJC of 2-1-2-4-5 means 2 instructional units based on class room lecture (L), one\\ninstructional unit of tutorial (T), one laboratory (P) based instructional unit (of 100 minutes),\\none project (J) component (of 200 minutes) - all delivered during a calendar week, and\\nrepeated for the entire duration of the semester to earn five credit (C) after passing the\\ncourse.\\nIn addition to these, specialized programs may have course component as directed by their \\nrespective council. For example, law program may incorporate 'moot court' as one of the course \\ncomponents. However, these deviations should be brought for approval by the Academic Council.\\n6.2 Minimum Credit Requirement\\n \\nThe minimum credit requirement for the completion of a program for students admitted is clearly \\nspecified in the program curriculum. Further, the student has to meet the course and credit \\ndistribution also as specified under 6.3, to become eligible for the degree. Due to various \\nfeatures of FFCS, it is possible for a student to attain the minimum credits without completing all \\nrequisite courses/credits under University Elective (UE)/Program Elective (PE) courses\\nindividually. Under such circumstances, though the student has attained the total minimum \\ncredits, it is mandatory for the student to complete all courses under UC and PC and also to\\nmeet the credit requirements under UE and PE, to become eligible for the degree.\\n6.3 Credit Distribution – Discipline Wise\\nIt is expected that all programs should accommodate courses from other disciplines, so that \\nthat the students will have multi-disciplinary exposure. All programs should provide sufficient \\nopportunity to students to enhance their communication, soft skills, management and the \\ntechnical skills. Depending on the program, the courses should fall under engineering, science, \\nhumanities and management categories. For examples, the credit distribution for the B.Tech.\\nprograms under CAL is given below.\\n7\\nDiscipline Percent share of minimum credit \\nrequirement\\nEngineering 60\\nScience 25\\nHumanities 10\\nManagement 05\\nA maximum of 3% deviation in credits is permitted under each discipline. While developing\\nthe curriculum, the school offering the program should ensure that the above distribution shall\\nbe attained by the students upon their completion of their curriculum. For other programs also, \\ncourses from different disciplines should be included in the curriculum. \\n6.4 Course Distribution\\nIn general, the curriculum of each program consists of courses that are grouped into University\\nCore (UC), Program Core (PC), Program Elective (PE) and University Elective (UE).\\n6.4.1 University Core (UC)\\nCourses listed under University Core are mandatory to all similar degree programs (B.Tech., \\nB.Sc., M.Tech. and so on). These courses are basic in nature and are expected to enhance\\nstudent’s fundamental knowledge in various disciplines apart from his/her own discipline\\ndepending on the requirement. UC courses may be added, removed or modified from time to\\ntime by the Academic Council. In few cases, a minimum credit requirement may be fixed to\\nbe met by taking one or more courses offered in a basket.\\nExample: UC specifies that each student should take a foreign language course(s) for 2\\ncredits. This can be met by taking any course offered from a basket of foreign language\\ncourses, like French, Arabic, Russian, Italian, German, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and others.\\n6.4.2 Program Core (PC)\\nCourses listed under Program Core of a curriculum are program specific. Students have to\\ncomplete all the courses listed under PC to become eligible for the degree.\\n6.4.3 Program Elective\\nBy taking courses under Program Elective, students get an opportunity to study courses which\\nare more advanced or applied or specialized than the basic courses he/she studies as part of\\nprogram core courses. These courses will generally provide an in-depth knowledge of a\\nspecific sub-field the student has taken as his/her major specialization. Assuming that the\\nCAL program curriculum stipulates that the number of credits a student should complete\\nunder PE is ‘x’, then the total credits offered under the PE in the curriculum for that\\nprogram should be approximately 2.5x credits, thus ensuring sufficient choice for the student.\\nThis is applicable to all programs of the University under CAL. This is also an upper limit\\ncondition to discourage listing PE courses that may not be offered in the near future. PE \\ncourses that are not offered to students or that have low student registration for two \\nconsecutive academic years shall be removed, so as to accommodate new courses. PE courses \\nplay a crucial role in offering ‘Honours’ credentials (section 13.2). If a new PE is added to a \\ncurriculum of a program, students adopting the earlier curriculum applicable to their year of \\njoining are also permitted to register the same as their PE, since it ultimately helps them to \\nexpand their knowledge. It is desirable that credits of PC:PE is the range 50:50 to 60:40.\\n8\\n6.4.4 University Elective (UE)\\nStudents can take any course as their UE, subject to the eligibility criteria specified under\\nAnnexure - II. Such a UE course cannot be either UC / PC specified in their curriculum. This\\ngives an opportunity for students to satisfy their aspirations in other disciplines also. The\\nnumber of credits a student is permitted to take under UE is fixed. This can be availed as\\na combination of smaller course credits as well, without any additional payment. Students\\nnot willing to take courses from other disciplines shall be permitted to take the PE courses\\nlisted in their curriculum (PE as UE), so as to fulfill the credits requirements under UE. An Audit\\ncourse (refer section 10) already cleared by the student cannot be credited again under the UE\\noption.\\n(e.g): 6 credits of UE course requirement can be met by taking two 3 credit courses or three 2\\ncredit courses. Students need not pay any additional course registration fees for registering 3\\ncourses instead of 2 courses.\\nGenerally, a course that forms a part of another curriculum of a program can be taken as a\\nUniversity Elective if that program is of the same degree level (viz. B.Tech. level, M.Tech. \\nlevel, UG level, PG level, etc.). Hence a course under UE for a particular program may be a PC\\nor PE for another program. If students wish to take a course having pre-requisites, then, they\\nhave to meet those pre-requisite conditions specified for that course to become eligible to\\nregister for the required course as their UE. Other degree program students can also\\ntake those courses as their UE if they meet the conditions specified in Annexure – II. PG level\\nCourses can also be taken as UE courses by UG program students subject to the conditions\\nstipulated under Section 11. A course that is not part of any program curriculum can also\\nbe specified as a UE course by declaring it suitable to a specific degree program(s) by the\\nUniversity. In addition, the university shall offer standalone courses related to Management / \\nHumanities. These courses can be registered under University Elective category. Some \\nspecialized programs (eg. MBA) may have the credits distributed under PC and PE only. \\n6.4.5. Experiential Learning\\nIndustrial Internship / Industrial exposure training: \\nDuring their tenure in the University, students get exposure to an academic environment\\nwhich is different from their future work environment, viz. industry, wherein they are expected\\nto be placed. To get this exposure, all students (B.Tech., M.Tech.Integrated, B.Des. Industrial \\nDesign, BBA, B.Sc. Catering and Hotel Management) should undergo four weeks of industrial\\ninternship in a reputed industry in their respective discipline of study, any time after their first\\nyear of study. The industrial internship carries 2 credits. The credit for such Industrial \\nexposure is accommodated in the University Core. B.Tech. students can avail this training i n a\\nsingle stretch of four weeks (28 days) or in two stretches of two-weeks duration. Each School\\nshall identify a faculty in-charge of Industrial Internship at program level who will assist the\\nstudents in identifying an industry and getting necessary approval from the industry. During\\nthe training, students are expected to maintain a digital log of their activity and learning. At\\nthe end of the training, a report along with completion certificate(s) from the Industry where\\nthey had received the training, are to be uploaded into the academic software. Subsequently,\\nSchools shall form “Industrial Internship evaluation committees” and award marks. Students\\nwho have completed their training may register for the industrial internship course in a\\nsubsequent semester for evaluation by the School. Based on entries made in the activity log, \\n9\\nthe industrial internship report and performance of the student during the related viva voce,\\nmarks may be awarded which shall lead to a performance grade. In a few programs, this is \\nreplaced by study tour and is aimed to provide additional exposure to students.\\n \\nCapstone Project / Master Thesis: \\n \\nStudents are expected to carry out an innovative project work during their final semester of\\nstudy for the credits prescribed under UC of their curriculum, in or related to the\\nspecialization of the program the student undergoes, by applying the knowledge they have\\ngained in the courses/ labs they have undergone so far. Through the project work, students\\nare expected to prove their analytical, design, fabrication ability and presentation skills.\\nDepending on the nature of the project work, an individual student or a group of students may\\ncarry out the project within the University or outside, viz. in an industry, private/ government\\norganization, or academic/ research institution. Each student will be assigned a faculty\\nmember as guide within their School. In suitable cases, with the permission of HoD/Program\\nChair, the student may opt for a guide outside their School also. In case of projects outside\\nthe University, there will be an external guide within the industry/ organization of work and\\nan internal guide within the School to which the student belongs to. In case of group project,\\nthe individual project report of each student in that group shall have different project titles so \\nas to bring out the individual’s contribution to the group project. Submitting a project that\\nwas bought (purchased/ borrowed/ submitted) in “VIT” or another University/ Institution shall\\nbe considered as examination malpractice and will be awarded an ‘N’ grade. The student has\\nto register again and clear the student project in a subsequent semester. Failure or absence\\nin the final viva-voce examination results in re-registration of the project. Though group \\nproject is permitted at undergraduate level programs, students of post graduate programs are \\nexpected to carry out individual projects. Project duration may be increased up to one year for \\nthe post-graduate Programs. Wherever needed, periodic reviews can be conducted through \\nvideo - conferencing. However, final viva voce examination will be conducted in person only.\\nStudents are expected to decide on the specific project area and title, and carry out\\nsubstantial portion of the literature survey during the end of their pre-final semester. After\\nthe end of their pre-final semester FATs, the students need to make a presentation to the\\n“Student Project Monitoring Committee” constituted by Schools concerned. The Project Work\\nmay be a work based on theoretical analysis, modeling & simulation, experimentation &\\nanalysis, prototype design, fabrication of new equipment, correlation and analysis of data, etc.\\nor a combination of these. Various time limits specified for monitoring and evaluation of\\nperformance of the student should be strictly followed (Refer Table below). The final project\\nreport will be evaluated by a panel of examiners consisting of HoD / Program Chair as\\nChairman of the Committee, External Examiner, one Internal Expert, Guide and Co- guide\\n(wherever applicable) and an oral examination will be conducted. The internal expert will be \\nnominated by the School Dean.\\nCapstone projects can be carried out as a single project connecting to domain specific issues\\nunder the guidance of a faculty. They can also opt for an alternative method of taking up on\\ninternship, in the last semester through the placement office. The students can undertake\\ndomain specific project work under the guidance of the assigned faculty guide during the \\nsame tenure of internship. The format of Student Project report should be in accordance to the \\nformat prescribed by the University/ School. All programs other than the M.Tech. shall have a \\nminimum period of one semester for carrying out the project work, in order to be qualified for \\n10\\nthe credits specified under UC of their curriculum. M.Tech. Master’s Thesis shall have two \\nsemesters or 9 months as the minimum project period. Students are permitted to do courses \\nalong with their project work, subject to the maximum credits permitted for registration as \\nspecified in Section 7.3.

The exact dates \\nfor the Comprehensive examination and the mode of examination will be announced by the \\nUniversity through circulars. Any student with a valid “GATE Score” is exempted from attending \\nthe Comprehensive Examination conducted by the institute for the purpose.\\n6.4.7. Additional learning\\n \\nIn order to make student learning capabilities more meaningful and activity- oriented,\\nprograms like Hack-a-thons, Make-a-thons and other similar activities are conducted on\\ncampus. In order to integrate this in academics, additional marks can be awarded to the\\nstudent by the faculty after due assessment of the performance of the student. The student\\ncan benefit through such additional marks, to a maximum of 10, which can be added to the \\nCAM scored for one course per semester or as per the directions given by the university, \\nthrough circulars. Similarly, additional marks can be given to students who take up take up \\nonline courses that are relevant to the registered course. If a student wishes to do a project in \\ncourses that do not have an embedded ‘J’-component and has a tangible output, the effort and \\noutput can be considered for the award of additional marks. The effort and output can be \\nconsidered for the award of additional marks. However, additional learning may not be limited \\nto the above activities. In any case, prior approval from the faculty handling the course and the \\nSchool Dean is essential for the inclusion of additional marks for such categories. This\\nadditional learning is course specific. It is the responsibility of the School to make sure that \\nadditional marks are allotted to only one course for a specified activity.

Course Registration \\nIt is mandatory for all students to register for courses that he/she wish to study in the\\nsemester through a Course Registration process. The Course Registration will be carried out on\\nspecific day(s) as declared by the University. Students having any outstanding dues to the\\nUniversity will be permitted to register for the courses, but will not be permitted to attend the \\nclasses till they pay the fees. For valid reasons, late registration for a maximum of 10 calendar\\ndays from the commencement of the semester may be permitted only with the approval of the\\nSchool Dean concerned and on payment of a late Registration fee as specified by the\\nUniversity. If a student fails to register the minimum number of courses in any semester,\\nhis/her studentship with the University is liable to be cancelled.\\nGenerally, students will be offered more courses than what a normal student is expected\\nto take. Depending on the requirements or from a ‘wish list’ collected from students, Schools\\ndecide the courses to be offered in each semester. Students shall register courses offered in\\neach semester and clear them, subject to various conditions as prescribed in this\\nRegulation. The list of courses offered by each program will be announced prior to the\\nregistration. Depending on academic and non-academic resources available to each\\nprogram, courses offered may vary. Students will get a chance to make their own plan of\\nstudy by changing the pace with which they study (fast/slow). Since slot timetable is\\nadopted, students can choose their own slots from multiple slots offered for the same course.\\nThe flowchart depicting the registration process is given in the Annexure IV. The given workflow \\nis only indicative and is subject to change depending on the requirement. \\n \\n7.1. Proctor (Assistance)\\nUpon joining the University, each student will be assigned a Proctor by the School concerned.\\nThe Proctor will discuss with the student on his/her academic performance in previous \\nsemester(s), periodically, and suggest the number and nature of courses to be registered in the \\nensuing semester, within the framework of that program curriculum. The proctor can refer to \\nVTOP / Program school to get information on the student curriculum and also his / her \\nacademic performance. This would help the Proctor guide students to register courses under \\nhis/her curriculum. Students having backlogs or under probation may get advice for pacing the \\nprogram accordingly.\\n7.2. Bridge Courses\\nDuring the first semester of all programs offered by the University, students will be advised to \\nregister for the courses (all or courses of their choice based on the guidance from the \\nHoD/Program Chair during the orientation) from the list of “Courses Offered” for their specific \\nprogram. Depending on the proficiency in language and other necessary fundamental \\ndisciplines, the student may be asked to undergo some special courses (bridge courses), as \\nrecommended by his/her program curriculum, to compensate his/her inadequacy of level. \\nThese courses will be recommended based on a screening test conducted by the University or \\nbased on the subjects a student has completed during his/her previous qualifying \\nexaminations. The credits and grades so obtained will not be counted in the CGPA calculation / \\ntowards the minimum credit requirements for the completion of the program as specified in\\nSection 6.2.\\n7.3. Minimum/ Maximum Credit Limits for Course Registration\\nThe number of credits most students are expected to register in a semester will be 23\\n(Average Academic Load) so that they complete the program within the specified duration\\nof the program. However, a student can register for a maximum of 27 credits or a minimum\\nof 16 credits in a regular semester (other than the optional terms). Under no circumstances\\na student, whether regular or timed-out, will be permitted to cross these limits. However, a\\nstudent carrying out the last registration of his/her program will be permitted to register less\\nthan 16 credits in order to meet the minimum credit requirements for the completion of\\ntheir program.\\nIf a student has CGPA less than 4.0 at any time of their study, the student will be advised to\\nregister for a maximum of 20 credits. If students with less than 4.0 CGPA fail to improve their\\nperformance in the subsequent semesters, their studentship is liable to be cancelled. A \\nCommittee under Dean of Academics will look into those cases and recommend to the Vice\\x02Chancellor on necessary further action to be initiated. \\nThe number of credits a student can register during a summer / intersession / weekend\\nsemester shall be between 6 and 8, or 2 courses, whichever is less. However, in special\\ncases, the student may be permitted to register a maximum of 12 credits with the approval\\nof the Proctor and School Dean. There is no minimum number of credits fixed for course \\nregistration during summer or intersession or weekend semester.\\n7.4. Registering for Backlog Courses\\nStudents who have not cleared one or more component(s) of a CAL course (Theory/ Lab/ J\\x02Component) are shown with “N” grade. If a student clears all the components individually but if \\nthe grand total of that course does not meet the passing range then \"F\" grade is awarded. A \\ncourse having an ‘F’ grade will be considered as a backlog and it has to be re- registered in the \\nsubsequent semesters or special terms. Students with F grade courses are eligible to register \\nthe next level course (pre-requisite is met). With N grade, if the student has cleared the theory \\ncomponent, he/she will be permitted to register the next level course (pre-requisite is met). Both \\nF and N have to be cleared by re-registering the same course in the subsequent semester/inter \\nsemester/ summer semester / subsequent intra-semester. If a student has not cleared all the \\ncomponents (or) if the student opts for Grade Improvement then all the components of the \\ncourse has to be re-registered. On the other hand, if the student has cleared in one or more \\ncomponents but got N grade in that course, then the cleared components are exempted from \\nre-registration. Re-registration fee will be as per the university norms existing at the time of re\\x02registration (whole or a component of a course). Such a re-registration fee is also applicable for \\nproject-only courses. When a course is re-registered wholly, all earlier course evaluation marks \\nshall be treated as cancelled/ reset. If a student fails in a course due to lack of marks in the \\nlab/project component of an embedded course, the student has to re-register the lab/project \\ncomponent alone. Courses having ‘W’ grade (course withdraw) will not be considered as \\nbacklog. Students who are debarred from writing FAT will be given “N” grade, for that course, in \\nthe grade sheet. To provide an early opportunity for students to clear their backlog of\\ncourses, efforts will be made to offer as many courses as possible during Fall, Winter,\\nIntersession and Summer semesters. Students have to pay a Re-registration fee, as specified\\nby the University from time to time, for the following cases: 1 ) Registration of a course for \\nwhich ‘N’ or ‘F’ or ‘W’ is given, or 2 ) registering a UE/PE (either same course or a \\nsubstitution course) which was not cleared in the previous semester(s).\\nHowever, students are given an option to clear the course by appearing for arrear examinations\\nafter their final semester. Students should register for all the course components if he/she opts \\nto clear the course through the arrear examinations. Component based registration is not \\napplicable for arrear examination. If a student fails to clear the course through arrear \\nexamination option and if he/she wishes to clear through re-registration, then the student \\nshould register for all the components of the course.\\n7.5. Add/Drop of Courses\\nOption to add or drop a course (from the registered courses) is given during the first three\\ninstructional days of the semester (not applicable to summer / intersession / weekend\\nsemesters), subject to the availability of resources and the minimum/ maximum number of \\ncredits required to be registered in a semester as specified in Section 7.3. Only those courses \\nthat stand registered at the end of Add/Drop process will be considered as final for that \\nsemester. The courses thus dropped will not appear in the semester Grade Sheet of the \\nstudent. The ‘dropped’ courses can be taken in the following semester when the courses are \\noffered. Add/Drop provision is not available for the courses registered during intersession /\\nsummer semester, in view of their short duration. Add/ Drop is only an option given to the \\nstudent. While exercising this option, if the student adds a new course, then the student’s \\nattendance is calculated from the date of adding the course. If he/she drops the course and \\nagain adds the same course then the attendance is calculated from the first date of adding the \\ncourse and no compensation/ transfer of attendance shall be permitted. There is no re\\x02registration fee for registering a ‘Dropped’ course again.\\n7.6. Course Withdrawal\\nIf a student feels that his/her performance in CAT-I of a registered course is not satisfactory,\\nthe student can withdraw from the course. After finalization of CAT-I marks, the University will\\nannounce suitable days for carrying out Course Withdrawal. Course Withdrawal will be open to\\nstudents for three instructional days as announced through circulars. Withdrawal below 16 \\ncredits is, generally, not permitted. However, final years and timed-out students are exempted \\nfrom the minimum withdrawal credit limit. Re-registered courses cannot be withdrawn, except \\nthose re-registered courses that have been cleared subsequently. If a registered additional/ re\\x02registered course is withdrawn, no refund will be made. A course once withdrawn through this \\nprocess cannot be reinstated again. Though courses withdrawn from shall be shown with a \\'W\\' \\ngrade under student academic history, they will not be listed in the semester Grade Sheet and \\nConsolidated Grade Sheet. The courses with ‘W’ grades will not be included for the calculation \\nof the grade point. Registered backlog courses cannot be withdrawn. Withdrawal from a course \\nis permitted subject to meeting the minimum credit limits for course registration as specified in \\nSection 7.3. When a withdrawn course is registered again or substituted by another course, \\nstudents need to pay re-registration charges at the time of registration / Withdrawal, as \\nannounced through circulars.\\n7.7. Course Prerequisites\\nSome courses may have specific prerequisites to be met before a student can register for\\nthe course. Generally, the student is expected to have cleared all the prerequisite courses\\nat the time of Course Registration. Students who had received an ‘F’ grade in a prerequisite\\ncourse are also permitted to register the next level course, assuming that they have attained\\nthe required ‘exposure’ by attending that course. In case the student has met the\\nminimum attendance as stipulated in Section 8, eligible to write the FAT, and also has written\\nthe FAT of a prerequisite course, but the result for the course is not yet declared (but not\\nwithheld) by the University, it will be assumed that the student has met the prerequisite\\ncondition by obtaining the required ‘exposure’ in that course. Under such circumstances,\\nthe student is permitted to register a higher-level course, with this course as prerequisite.\\nSubsequently, when the results are declared by the University and if the student is awarded\\nan ‘F’ grade in the course, which was a prerequisite course, the Registration made for the\\nhigher-level course will not be cancelled. This stand is adopted so that the student can make\\nfurther progress towards earning credits and his/her progress need not be pulled down by\\nbacklog courses.\\nSimilar to a prerequisite, a course may have an anti-requisite and/ or co-requisite. When two\\ncourses having almost similar/ same course contents, considered as equivalent, are made\\navailable to a student to choose, in order to prevent students crediting both the courses,\\nthe anti-requisite option can be used. Similarly, an independent laboratory course can be\\ncoupled to a theory-alone course through a co-requisite thereby forcing a student to register\\nboth the courses together', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': 'Course_registration.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '7def8f8ec195555c44c8f6c3937c52f0'}>, <Document: {'content': 'Attendance\\nA student is expected to maintain 100% attendance in all courses.

It \\nmust be noted that Honours award will be mentioned in the Degree Certificate as\\n“Bachelor of Technology in (specialization) with Honours”. This fact will also be reflected in\\nthe Consolidated Grade Sheet under a separate heading ‘Honours’ with similar details shown\\nfor other credited courses and the CGPA for ‘Honours’ will be indicated at the end of list of\\ncourses under ‘Honours’. The grades obtained in the courses credited towards the ‘Honours’\\naward are not counted and shall have no influence on the GPA/ CGPA of the ‘programme’ \\nstudent has registered\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': 'honors.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '5bd6ea614038ce71d47b4e2b91d5f3f9'}>]\n"

            " 'documents': [<Document: {'content': '7. Course Registration \\nIt is mandatory for all students to register for courses that he/she wish to study in the\\nsemester through a Course Registration process. The Course Registration will be carried out on\\nspecific day(s) as declared by the University. Students having any outstanding dues to the\\nUniversity will be permitted to register for the courses, but will not be permitted to attend the \\nclasses till they pay the fees. For valid reasons, late registration for a maximum of 10 calendar\\ndays from the commencement of the semester may be permitted only with the approval of the\\nSchool Dean concerned and on payment of a late Registration fee as specified by the\\nUniversity. If a student fails to register the minimum number of courses in any semester,\\nhis/her studentship with the University is liable to be cancelled.\\nGenerally, students will be offered more courses than what a normal student is expected\\nto take. Depending on the requirements or from a ‘wish list’ collected from students, Schools\\ndecide the courses to be offered in each semester. Students shall register courses offered in\\neach semester and clear them, subject to various conditions as prescribed in this\\nRegulation. The list of courses offered by each program will be announced prior to the\\nregistration. Depending on academic and non-academic resources available to each\\nprogram, courses offered may vary. Students will get a chance to make their own plan of\\nstudy by changing the pace with which they study (fast/slow). Since slot timetable is\\nadopted, students can choose their own slots from multiple slots offered for the same course.\\nThe flowchart depicting the registration process is given in the Annexure IV. The given workflow \\nis only indicative and is subject to change depending on the requirement. \\n \\n7.1. Proctor (Assistance)\\nUpon joining the University, each student will be assigned a Proctor by the School concerned.\\nThe Proctor will discuss with the student on his/her academic performance in previous \\nsemester(s), periodically, and suggest the number and nature of courses to be registered in the \\nensuing semester, within the framework of that program curriculum. The proctor can refer to \\nVTOP / Program school to get information on the student curriculum and also his / her \\nacademic performance. This would help the Proctor guide students to register courses under \\nhis/her curriculum. Students having backlogs or under probation may get advice for pacing the \\nprogram accordingly.\\n7.2. Bridge Courses\\nDuring the first semester of all programs offered by the University, students will be advised to \\nregister for the courses (all or courses of their choice based on the guidance from the \\nHoD/Program Chair during the orientation) from the list of “Courses Offered” for their specific \\nprogram. Depending on the proficiency in language and other necessary fundamental \\ndisciplines, the student may be asked to undergo some special courses (bridge courses), as \\nrecommended by his/her program curriculum, to compensate his/her inadequacy of level. \\nThese courses will be recommended based on a screening test conducted by the University or \\nbased on the subjects a student has completed during his/her previous qualifying \\nexaminations. The credits and grades so obtained will not be counted in the CGPA calculation / \\ntowards the minimum credit requirements for the completion of the program as specified in\\nSection 6.2.\\n7.3. Minimum/ Maximum Credit Limits for Course Registration\\nThe number of credits most students are expected to register in a semester will be 23\\n(Average Academic Load) so that they complete the program within the specified duration\\nof the program. However, a student can register for a maximum of 27 credits or a minimum\\nof 16 credits in a regular semester (other than the optional terms). Under no circumstances\\na student, whether regular or timed-out, will be permitted to cross these limits. However, a\\nstudent carrying out the last registration of his/her program will be permitted to register less\\nthan 16 credits in order to meet the minimum credit requirements for the completion of\\ntheir program.\\nIf a student has CGPA less than 4.0 at any time of their study, the student will be advised to\\nregister for a maximum of 20 credits. If students with less than 4.0 CGPA fail to improve their\\nperformance in the subsequent semesters, their studentship is liable to be cancelled. A \\nCommittee under Dean of Academics will look into those cases and recommend to the Vice\\x02Chancellor on necessary further action to be initiated. \\nThe number of credits a student can register during a summer / intersession / weekend\\nsemester shall be between 6 and 8, or 2 courses, whichever is less. However, in special\\ncases, the student may be permitted to register a maximum of 12 credits with the approval\\nof the Proctor and School Dean. There is no minimum number of credits fixed for course \\nregistration during summer or intersession or weekend semester.\\n7.4. Registering for Backlog Courses\\nStudents who have not cleared one or more component(s) of a CAL course (Theory/ Lab/ J\\x02Component) are shown with “N” grade. If a student clears all the components individually but if \\nthe grand total of that course does not meet the passing range then \"F\" grade is awarded. A \\ncourse having an ‘F’ grade will be considered as a backlog and it has to be re- registered in the \\nsubsequent semesters or special terms. Students with F grade courses are eligible to register \\nthe next level course (pre-requisite is met). With N grade, if the student has cleared the theory \\ncomponent, he/she will be permitted to register the next level course (pre-requisite is met). Both \\nF and N have to be cleared by re-registering the same course in the subsequent semester/inter \\nsemester/ summer semester / subsequent intra-semester. If a student has not cleared all the \\ncomponents (or) if the student opts for Grade Improvement then all the components of the \\ncourse has to be re-registered. On the other hand, if the student has cleared in one or more \\ncomponents but got N grade in that course, then the cleared components are exempted from \\nre-registration. Re-registration fee will be as per the university norms existing at the time of re\\x02registration (whole or a component of a course). Such a re-registration fee is also applicable for \\nproject-only courses. When a course is re-registered wholly, all earlier course evaluation marks \\nshall be treated as cancelled/ reset. If a student fails in a course due to lack of marks in the \\nlab/project component of an embedded course, the student has to re-register the lab/project \\ncomponent alone. Courses having ‘W’ grade (course withdraw) will not be considered as \\nbacklog. Students who are debarred from writing FAT will be given “N” grade, for that course, in \\nthe grade sheet. To provide an early opportunity for students to clear their backlog of\\ncourses, efforts will be made to offer as many courses as possible during Fall, Winter,\\nIntersession and Summer semesters. Students have to pay a Re-registration fee, as specified\\nby the University from time to time, for the following cases: 1 ) Registration of a course for \\nwhich ‘N’ or ‘F’ or ‘W’ is given, or 2 ) registering a UE/PE (either same course or a \\nsubstitution course) which was not cleared in the previous semester(s).\\nHowever, students are given an option to clear the course by appearing for arrear examinations\\nafter their final semester. Students should register for all the course components if he/she opts \\nto clear the course through the arrear examinations. Component based registration is not \\napplicable for arrear examination. If a student fails to clear the course through arrear \\nexamination option and if he/she wishes to clear through re-registration, then the student \\nshould register for all the components of the course.\\n7.5. Add/Drop of Courses\\nOption to add or drop a course (from the registered courses) is given during the first three\\ninstructional days of the semester (not applicable to summer / intersession / weekend\\nsemesters), subject to the availability of resources and the minimum/ maximum number of \\ncredits required to be registered in a semester as specified in Section 7.3. Only those courses \\nthat stand registered at the end of Add/Drop process will be considered as final for that \\nsemester. The courses thus dropped will not appear in the semester Grade Sheet of the \\nstudent. The ‘dropped’ courses can be taken in the following semester when the courses are \\noffered. Add/Drop provision is not available for the courses registered during intersession /\\nsummer semester, in view of their short duration. Add/ Drop is only an option given to the \\nstudent. While exercising this option, if the student adds a new course, then the student’s \\nattendance is calculated from the date of adding the course. If he/she drops the course and \\nagain adds the same course then the attendance is calculated from the first date of adding the \\ncourse and no compensation/ transfer of attendance shall be permitted. There is no re\\x02registration fee for registering a ‘Dropped’ course again.\\n7.6. Course Withdrawal\\nIf a student feels that his/her performance in CAT-I of a registered course is not satisfactory,\\nthe student can withdraw from the course. After finalization of CAT-I marks, the University will\\nannounce suitable days for carrying out Course Withdrawal. Course Withdrawal will be open to\\nstudents for three instructional days as announced through circulars. Withdrawal below 16 \\ncredits is, generally, not permitted. However, final years and timed-out students are exempted \\nfrom the minimum withdrawal credit limit. Re-registered courses cannot be withdrawn, except \\nthose re-registered courses that have been cleared subsequently. If a registered additional/ re\\x02registered course is withdrawn, no refund will be made. A course once withdrawn through this \\nprocess cannot be reinstated again. Though courses withdrawn from shall be shown with a \\'W\\' \\ngrade under student academic history, they will not be listed in the semester Grade Sheet and \\nConsolidated Grade Sheet. The courses with ‘W’ grades will not be included for the calculation \\nof the grade point. Registered backlog courses cannot be withdrawn. Withdrawal from a course \\nis permitted subject to meeting the minimum credit limits for course registration as specified in \\nSection 7.3. When a withdrawn course is registered again or substituted by another course, \\nstudents need to pay re-registration charges at the time of registration / Withdrawal, as \\nannounced through circulars.\\n7.7. Course Prerequisites\\nSome courses may have specific prerequisites to be met before a student can register for\\nthe course. Generally, the student is expected to have cleared all the prerequisite courses\\nat the time of Course Registration. Students who had received an ‘F’ grade in a prerequisite\\ncourse are also permitted to register the next level course, assuming that they have attained\\nthe required ‘exposure’ by attending that course. In case the student has met the\\nminimum attendance as stipulated in Section 8, eligible to write the FAT, and also has written\\nthe FAT of a prerequisite course, but the result for the course is not yet declared (but not\\nwithheld) by the University, it will be assumed that the student has met the prerequisite\\ncondition by obtaining the required ‘exposure’ in that course. Under such circumstances,\\nthe student is permitted to register a higher-level course, with this course as prerequisite.\\nSubsequently, when the results are declared by the University and if the student is awarded\\nan ‘F’ grade in the course, which was a prerequisite course, the Registration made for the\\nhigher-level course will not be cancelled. This stand is adopted so that the student can make\\nfurther progress towards earning credits and his/her progress need not be pulled down by\\nbacklog courses.\\nSimilar to a prerequisite, a course may have an anti-requisite and/ or co-requisite. When two\\ncourses having almost similar/ same course contents, considered as equivalent, are made\\navailable to a student to choose, in order to prevent students crediting both the courses,\\nthe anti-requisite option can be used. Similarly, an independent laboratory course can be\\ncoupled to a theory-alone course through a co-requisite thereby forcing a student to register\\nboth the courses together', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6514785172594421, 'meta': {'name': 'Course_registration.txt'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '7def8f8ec195555c44c8f6c3937c52f0'}>,\n",

Students who have\\nan ‘F’ grade need to re-register the course again to clear it. There will be no pass/fail criteria\\nin continuous assessments. The letter grades and their corresponding grade points are given in \\nthe Annexure – VI. The remarks column in the table describes the circumstance under which\\nthe specific grade is offered. The student registration details in FFCS will reflect the status of \\ncurrently registered and yet to be completed course components as ‘Y’. \\nA student is declared to have passed/ cleared a course, if he/she has earned any one of the\\nfollowing grades: ‘S, A, B, C, D, E or P, called the ‘Performance Grades’.

Students who fail to clear a course due to their poor performance;\\nII. Student clears all the components individually, but if the grand total of \\nthat course does not meet the passing range, then “F” grade is \\nawarded. \\nTo clear an ‘F’ grade, students should re-register for the entire course in the subsequent\\nsemester(s).\\nThe letter grade ‘N’ has been sub- categorized as follows:\\ni. N1 : Student fails to clear one or more components of a course\\nii. N2 : Student who has been debarred due to lack of attendance\\niii. N3 : Student who remains absent in the Final Assessment Test\\niv. N4 : Student debarred in Final Assessment Test due to indiscipline / malpractice\\nStudents who fail to write the FAT due to valid medical reasons, will be initially awarded an\\n‘N’ grade. They are eligible to apply for supplementary FAT as indicated in Section 9.10. If\\nthey fail to appear for the supplementary FAT as per the schedule for any reason –\\nincluding medical or non-medical, the grade ‘N’ already awarded will be retained as it is\\nand no second chance will be provided to them. The ‘N’ grade will be converted into a\\nperformance grade after the student takes up the supplementary FAT. However, the student\\nis bound to appear for the auxiliary FAT within one academic year or whenever it is \\nscheduled from the date of approval, whichever is earliest. If a student fails to write the FAT\\ndue to reasons other than the one indicated above, shall be awarded ‘N’ grade by treating the\\ncourse as incomplete. Letter grade ‘N’ carries ‘Zero’ grade point and to qualify the course,\\nthe student has to register the course again in a subsequent semester and complete the\\nsame with a ‘performance’ grade.
